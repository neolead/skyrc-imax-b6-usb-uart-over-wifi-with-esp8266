Skyrc IMAX B6 - uart to serial port over esp8266 client-server
Server part is for native esp8266 client part for nodemcu or esp8266+ftdi(uart to serial)

ap-server.ino is for esp8266 (connect to imax b6)
client.ino is for nodemcu or esp8266 with ftdi adapter (plug to pc and use port for dataexplorer)

Software for monitoring:
LogView
DataExplorer

After tests, i put esp8266 inside imax, i soldered +5v(with step down voltage to 3.3, from back side of the screen, 2nd pin), gnd and uart from connector.
